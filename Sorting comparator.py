Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score. 
If 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically ascending by name. 
To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, 
then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) 
method. In short, when sorting in ascending order, a comparator function returns -1 if a<b, 0 if a=b,
and 1 if a>b.
